## Overview

Slotify is a parking management demo where every action — vehicle arrival, slot assignment, route calculation, search, and undo — flows through a hand-implemented data structure stack. There is no `java.util.PriorityQueue` or `TreeMap` doing the heavy lifting invisibly; each structure is built from scratch and exercised end-to-end.

On startup, a `CommandLineRunner` boot demo fires automatically, so you can observe the full data-structure pipeline in your terminal without making a single API call.

## Architecture: Data Structures at a Glance

| Component | Structure | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `VehicleLinkedList` | Doubly linked list | Stores vehicles in arrival order; supports reverse traversal and plate-based removal |
| `GateManager` | Queue + undo stack | Manages the entrance queue; stack records actions for reversal |
| `SlotAssigner` | Manual min-heap | Assigns the nearest available slot — `O(log n)` insert and extract |
| `RouteGraph` | Weighted graph + Dijkstra | Computes the shortest path through the lot; exports a Graphviz DOT string |
| `SystemDatabase` | HashMap + AVL BST | HashMap for `O(1)` plate lookups; AVL tree for stable ordered search and traversal |

A single vehicle arrival touches **all five structures** in sequence: queue → linked list → hash map → AVL tree → heap assignment → route → undo stack.

---

## How It Works

### Vehicle arrival
1. The plate is enqueued in `GateManager`.
2. The vehicle is appended to `VehicleLinkedList` (arrival order preserved).
3. The record is inserted into `SystemDatabase` — stored in both the HashMap and AVL BST simultaneously.

### Processing
4. The front of the queue is dequeued.
5. `SlotAssigner` extracts the minimum slot from the min-heap (nearest available).
6. `RouteGraph` runs Dijkstra from the gate node to the assigned slot node and returns the full path.
7. An `UndoAction` (vehicle + slot + timestamp) is pushed onto the undo stack.

### Undo
8. The top `UndoAction` is popped.
9. The vehicle is removed from the linked list by plate, deleted from the AVL tree and hash map, and the slot is returned to the min-heap.

### Search and listing
- Plate-based lookup hits the HashMap directly — `O(1)` average.
- `getAllSorted()` performs an in-order traversal of the AVL BST — keys returned in alphabetical order with no extra sorting step.

## Interactive Dashboard (Frontend)

The system includes a fully responsive, high-fidelity web command center (`http://localhost:8081`) that visually exposes and animates the underlying data structures in real-time:
- **High-Tech Branded OS Boot Loader:** Features a modern, advanced full-screen radar HUD concentric ring loader with progressive status animations, a segmented loading bar, and active Node/Sensor panels to eliminate white browser flashes.
- **Visual Doubly Linked List Pointers:** Every vehicle database card displays live Prev and Next node memory link addresses (`Prev: [PLATE] ↔ Next: [PLATE]`) directly on-screen to illustrate dynamic RAM linkages.
- **Collapsible LIFO Stack Action Panel:** Renders Gate Operations backtrack history. Custom green `PUSH` and red `POP` badges flash during action updates.
- **Min-Heap Triangle Tree Visualizer:** Available slots are displayed as a geometric binary tree, animating extract-min transitions and priority bubble-up re-heapification in real-time.
- **Dijkstra pathing HUD & Edge Weights:** Graph driveways display glowing active edge distances. A canvas HUD overlay displays Dijkstra's algorithm time complexity alongside calculated `Explored Nodes` and `Shortest Path` node sizes.
- **AVL Balanced BST Traversal:** In Database view, toggle `"Tree View [AVL]"` to observe a balanced alphabetic search tree. Plate queries sequentially pulse down left or right branches before flashing the target green.
- **Hash Table Glow Flash:** Highlights the direct bucket slot match for $O(1)$ lookups with neon-cyan border sweeps for 1.5 seconds.
- **System Integration Architecture Table:** Displays a technical summary tracing the concrete role and space/time complexities of all 7 data structures.
- **Intelligent Layout Polish:** Clean multiline wrapping on pathing routes, sleek custom timeline scrollbars, and vibrant neon accents for clear, overlap-free dashboards.

## Complexity Summary

| Operation | Structure | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| Enqueue / dequeue | Queue | `O(1)` |
| Undo push / pop | Stack | `O(1)` |
| Slot insert | Min-heap | `O(log n)` |
| Slot extract-min | Min-heap | `O(log n)` |
| Record insert / search / delete | AVL BST | `O(log n)` |
| Plate lookup | HashMap | `O(1)` avg |
| Remove by plate | Doubly linked list | `O(n)` — node must be located first |
| Shortest path | Dijkstra (adjacency list) | `O((V + E) log V)` |

---

## Graph Layout

The lot is modelled as a weighted, bidirectional graph with nodes `0..8`. Slots `101..105` are each connected to multiple graph nodes, giving Dijkstra genuine routing choices rather than a trivial single-path graph.

```
Gate (node 0) ──── 1 ──── 2
    │                     │
    3 ──── 4 ──── 5 ──── 6
    │             │
    7 ──────────── 8
    │
 Slots 101–105 (connected to multiple nodes)
```

Paste the output of `GET /api/mapdot` into [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) or run locally:

```bash
dot -Tpng slotify.dot -o slotify.png
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 or newer** — check with `java -version`
- No system-wide Maven required — the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd`) is included

### Run

**Windows**
```bash
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Package and run the JAR directly**
```bash
# Windows
mvnw.cmd clean package
java -jar target/slotify-1.0.0.jar

# macOS / Linux
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/slotify-1.0.0.jar
```

### Access

Once the app starts, open:

```
http://localhost:8081
```

The boot demo output appears in your terminal immediately — arrivals, processing, undo, sorted listing, and the DOT graph string are all printed before you make any API call.

---

## Boot Demo Output

The `CommandLineRunner` executes this sequence automatically on every startup:

```
[ARRIVE]   ABC-123 (Alice)  → queued, added to linked list + AVL + HashMap
[ARRIVE]   XYZ-999 (Bob)    → queued, added to linked list + AVL + HashMap
[PROCESS]  ABC-123          → slot 101 assigned | route: 0 → 3 → 7 → 101
[PROCESS]  XYZ-999          → slot 102 assigned | route: 0 → 1 → 4 → 102
[UNDO]     XYZ-999          → slot 102 released, record removed, queue restored
[SORTED]   All vehicles (AVL in-order): ABC-123, XYZ-999
[DOT]      digraph slotify { ... }
```

## Notes

- **Run via Maven Wrapper**, not your editor's single-file Java runner — the runner bypasses Spring Boot's application context.
- If port `8081` is already in use, stop the previous Slotify instance or change `server.port` in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
- The AVL tree rebalances on every insert and delete, so `getAllSorted()` always returns stable ordered output regardless of insertion sequence.
- The min-heap is implemented entirely in `ManualMinHeap.java` with no reliance on `java.util.PriorityQueue` — `heapifyUp` fires on insert, `heapifyDown` fires on `extractMin`.
